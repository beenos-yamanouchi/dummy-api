Tanjiro immediately understood that his family had been attacked by demons, with his sister Nezuko as the only survivor.

People who like Japanese animation are certainly familiar with the term anthropomorphism. In the world of animation, many different types of &#8216;anthropomorphism&#8217; have been depicted, including text, everyday objects, weather, emotions, etc. Continuing on from this tradition, in the 2015 &#8220;Monthly Shonen Sirius&#8221;, a new popular &#8216;anthropomorphic work&#8217; appeared &#8211; the manga series &#8216;Cells at Work!&#8217;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Vibrant, Hidden Setting of Cells at Work!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The original manga series of Cells at Work! began in 2015, and a related anime produced by the animation company David Production started its broadcast from 2018. The main draw of this series is the anthropomorphism of the cells that we all have within our bodies. With interesting and humorous scenarios, we can learn more about the daily operation of our bodies, the importance of the various cells in our bodies from the perspective of the stories and experiences of the red blood cell protagonist. This fun series exhibits an impressive amount of knowledge about how the cells in the human body operate!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Makes Cells at Work! So Fun To Read?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>The story of Cells at Work! begins with the daily routine of the protagonist AE3803, who is a female red blood cell. Like other cells, she does not have a personal name in the same way that a human would. However, AE3803 does have other nicknames, such as &#8216;Senpai&#8217; or &#8216;Big Sister Red Blood Cell&#8217;. Different red blood cells have different personalities, and AE3803&#8217;s personality is particularly reckless, with her often getting lost in the blood vessels. Although she often delivers the wrong goods, and encounters germs and other crises, every time AE3803 seems to be rescued by the same white blood cell, who is responsible for removing the germs. But don&#8217;t mistake this part of Cells at Work! for a love story! Because white blood cells can travel to various parts of the body very quickly, this is another big reason why they are able to save AE3803 every time they come to clear the germs!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>In the story, in addition to the main red blood cell and white blood cell characters that were just mentioned, there are also many other cells with strong personalities that are responsible for different tasks in the body, such as the child-like Platelet like children, the muscle-bound Killer T Cell, the motherly Macrophage and more!

In the world of animation, many different types of &#8216;anthropomorphism&#8217; have been depicted, including text, everyday objects, weather, emotions, etc. Continuing on from this tradition, in the 2015 &#8220;Monthly Shonen Sirius&#8221;, a new popular &#8216;anthropomorphic work&#8217; appeared &#8211; the manga series &#8216;Cells at Work!&#8217;\n\n\n\nThe Vibrant, Hidden Setting of Cells at Work!\n\n\n\nThe original manga series of Cells at Work! began in 2015, and a related anime produced by the animation company David Production started its broadcast from 2018.

Different red blood cells have different personalities, and AE3803&#8217;s personality is particularly reckless, with her often getting lost in the blood vessels. Although she often delivers the wrong goods, and encounters germs and other crises, every time AE3803 seems to be rescued by the same white blood cell, who is responsible for removing the germs. But don&#8217;t mistake this part of Cells at Work! for a love story! Because white blood cells can travel to various parts of the body very quickly, this is another big reason why they are able to save AE3803 every time they come to clear the germs!\n\n\n\nIn the story, in addition to the main red blood cell and white blood cell characters that were just mentioned, there are also many other cells with strong personalities that are responsible for different tasks in the body, such as the child-like Platelet like children, the muscle-bound Killer T Cell, the motherly Macrophage and more!

Whether it is Spiderman or Captain America in the United States, Ultraman or Kamen Rider in Japan, etc., heroes like these are beloved by dedicated fans the world over. In addition to these popular superheroes, there is a group of heroes from Japan that we hope you can become more familiar with &#8211; the main characters of the Japanese manga series &#8216;My Hero Academia&#8217;!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">The World of My Hero Academia</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the world of My Hero Academia, abbreviated as &#8216;Hiroaka&#8217;, from a certain day, a large number of new generations of children suddenly began to have special abilities called Quirks. Nearly everyone who is born from this day on has some form of Quirk ability, and everyone&#8217;s Quirks has different characteristics. Overwhelming superpowers that previously had only existed in the realm of fiction are brought in reality, throwing human society into chaos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People with special abilities and evil thoughts begin to use their Quirks for evil. These people are commonly known as Villians. Opposing these villians, those who possess both special abilities and a sense of justice are seen just like superheroes in everyone’s impression. Whenever the villains are destroying communities and causing chaos, these heroes will run out to fight and save those ordinary bystanders with no special Quirks.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">The Protagonist has no Quirks?!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The protagonist Izuku Midoriya was born in an era when basically everyone has a personality and the world is full of heroes. Like other children, he has loved heroes since childhood. He is an especially big fan of the hero All Might, and hope to be a hero when he grows up. The new generation with personality usually shows signs of personality when he was young, but the signs of Quirks still would not appear. Due to his dream of being a hero, Izuku felt great regret at his diagnosis. The dream can never be realized. But one day when his friend Bakugo is attacked by a villain, Izuku unconsciously ran to face the enemy to save his friend, regardless of having no special abilities. This act of selfless heroism by this ordinary boy led All Might to decide that Izuku has a heroic temperament.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">Even a Strong Hero Needs Partners!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Izuku has no Quirks, there is still a chance to inherit All Might&#8217;s abilities and become a hero through tough training. In order to become a hero, he starts to attend the hero’s school U.A. High School. Under the guidance of many heroes and teachers, Izuku works hard with his classmates to carry out various assignments and tasks to achieve his dreams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, there was a deep mysteries with the hero All Might&#8217;s ability known as One For All, and an enemy trying to seize that ability soon appears. Izuku, who is gradually inheriting this ability, has naturally become the enemy&#8217;s target. In order to protect the inherited abilities, All Might and others around him have gradually become isolated, with many secrets that cannot be disclosed. At times, Izuku may have to fight alone, but his partners (classmates and teachers) did not intend to let him get overwhelmed by enemies, and show up to support him when the time is right!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">My Hero Academia&#8217;s Main Players &#8211; 8 Heroes and 2 Villains!</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">Izuku Midoriya</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://buyee.jp/category/yahoo/shopping/2511?query=%E7%B7%91%E8%B0%B7%20%E5%87%BA%E4%B9%85\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"536\" src=\"https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/banner_1200x628_02-15-1024x536.jpg\" alt=\"Izuku Midoriya\" class=\"wp-image-9090\" srcset=\"https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/banner_1200x628_02-15-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/banner_1200x628_02-15-300x157.jpg 300w, https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/banner_1200x628_02-15-768x402.jpg 768w, https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/banner_1200x628_02-15.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The hero of My Hero Academia is rare in that he has no Quirk special abilities.

Whether it is Spiderman or Captain America in the United States, Ultraman or Kamen Rider in Japan, etc., heroes like these are beloved by dedicated fans the world over. In addition to these popular superheroes, there is a group of heroes from Japan that we hope you can become more familiar with &#8211; the main characters of the Japanese manga series &#8216;My Hero Academia&#8217;!\n\n\n\nThe World of My Hero Academia\n\n\n\nIn the world of My Hero Academia, abbreviated as &#8216;Hiroaka&#8217;, from a certain day, a large number of new generations of children suddenly began to have special abilities called Quirks. Nearly everyone who is born from this day on has some form of Quirk ability, and everyone&#8217;s Quirks has different characteristics. Overwhelming superpowers that previously had only existed in the realm of fiction are brought in reality, throwing human society into chaos.\n\n\n\nPeople with special abilities and evil thoughts begin to use their Quirks for evil. These people are commonly known as Villians. Opposing these villians, those who possess both special abilities and a sense of justice are seen just like superheroes in everyone’s impression. Whenever the villains are destroying communities and causing chaos, these heroes will run out to fight and save those ordinary bystanders with no special Quirks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Protagonist has no Quirks?!\n\n\n\nThe protagonist Izuku Midoriya was born in an era when basically everyone has a personality and the world is full of heroes. Like other children, he has loved heroes since childhood. He is an especially big fan of the hero All Might, and hope to be a hero when he grows up. The new generation with personality usually shows signs of personality when he was young, but the signs of Quirks still would not appear. Due to his dream of being a hero, Izuku felt great regret at his diagnosis. The dream can never be realized. But one day when his friend Bakugo is attacked by a villain, Izuku unconsciously ran to face the enemy to save his friend, regardless of having no special abilities. This act of selfless heroism by this ordinary boy led All Might to decide that Izuku has a heroic temperament.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven a Strong Hero Needs Partners!\n\n\n\nAlthough Izuku has no Quirks, there is still a chance to inherit All Might&#8217;s abilities and become a hero through tough training. In order to become a hero, he starts to attend the hero’s school U.A. High School. Under the guidance of many heroes and teachers, Izuku works hard with his classmates to carry out various assignments and tasks to achieve his dreams.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, there was a deep mysteries with the hero All Might&#8217;s ability known as One For All, and an enemy trying to seize that ability soon appears. Izuku, who is gradually inheriting this ability, has naturally become the enemy&#8217;s target. In order to protect the inherited abilities, All Might and others around him have gradually become isolated, with many secrets that cannot be disclosed. At times, Izuku may have to fight alone, but his partners (classmates and teachers) did not intend to let him get overwhelmed by enemies, and show up to support him when the time is right!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Hero Academia&#8217;s Main Players &#8211; 8 Heroes and 2 Villains!\n\n\n\nIzuku Midoriya\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hero of My Hero Academia is rare in that he has no Quirk special abilities. He is a super fan of the hero All Might, and hopes to become a hero when he grows up. But after a doctor&#8217;s diagnosis, he found that he had no special skills, and his dream of becoming a hero was broken. When his friend Bakugo was attacked by a villain, he unconsciously ran to face the enemy to save his friend, which made the hero All Might realize that Izuku has a heroic temperament, and begin to hope that he could inherit his Quirk ability, known as &#8216;One For All&#8217;, and become its 9th generation successor.\n\n\n\n\nFind Izuku Midoriya Goods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKatsuki Bakugo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBakugo has known the protagonist Midoriya from a young age, and he was not friendly to him in the beginning of the story.

Starting from this reunion, the story continues from their perspectives and looks closely at the various causal relationships brought about by the war.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Mobile Suits of Gundam SEED&#8217;s World</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">ZGMF-X10A Freedom Gundam</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://buyee.jp/category/yahoo/shopping/2511?query=%E3%83%95%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%80%E3%83%A0%E3%82%AC%E3%83%B3%E3%83%80%E3%83%A0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"536\" src=\"https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/banner_1200x628_02-8-1024x536.jpg\" alt=\"ZGMF-X10A Freedom Gundam\" class=\"wp-image-9016\" srcset=\"https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/banner_1200x628_02-8-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/banner_1200x628_02-8-300x157.jpg 300w, https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/banner_1200x628_02-8-768x402.jpg 768w, https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/banner_1200x628_02-8.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main Gundams of the SEED universe, piloted by Kira Yamato, the main protagonist of the original Mobile Suit Gundam SEED.

        "content_text": "Mobile Suit Gundam SEED is an especially popular subseries within the Japanese Gundam anime franchise. Recently, fresh news related to this classic series come out that really surprised fans &#8211; A new SEED theatrical episode is now in production! Originally, there had been several SEED compilation movies produced before, so it’s not entirely surprising, but this new work, Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Eclipse, is different, as it tells a new story in the timeline. As the SEED Destiny series ended in Japan in 2005, it is a happy surprise to see a sequel in 2021!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Setting of Gundam SEED\n\n\n\nMobile Suit Gundam SEED, directed by Mitsuo Fukuda, covers the story of Kira Yamato, who was born in an era called the &#8220;Cosmic Era&#8221;. Humans in this world are divided into &#8220;Naturals&#8221;, born and raised naturally on earth, and &#8220;Coordinators&#8221;, who were born after genetic modification.

JAPAN Auction) and online flea market services have considerable resale values.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, here&#8217;s a price comparison of the <strong>Kangaskhan 1998 Japanese Parent and Child Mega Battle Event Trophy </strong>card between listings on Yahoo! JAPAN Auction and eBay. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>On Yahoo Auction</strong>: The Kangaskhan card was won at<strong> 900,000 yen </strong>(approx. $8.532) with a buyout price of 1.25M yen. <br>This card was described as being in mint condition. Since most Japanese sellers are not familiar with the PSA card grading system, they usually describe their card as mint, near mint, good condition, bad condition, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"810\" height=\"665\" src=\"https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/kang_buyee-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8878\" srcset=\"https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/kang_buyee-1.jpg 810w, https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/kang_buyee-1-300x246.jpg 300w, https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/kang_buyee-1-768x631.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>On eBay</strong>: There are listings from <strong>5,493,297 yen</strong> (approx. 50,000 USD) for a PSA 3 Very Good graded card to <strong>54,383,652 yen</strong> (approx. 500,000 USD) for a PSA 10 Gem Mint graded card, with an market average of<strong> 28,586,407 yen</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"901\" src=\"https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-1024x901.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8877\" srcset=\"https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-1024x901.png 1024w, https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-300x264.png 300w, https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-768x676.png 768w, https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The non-graded mint <strong>Kangaskhan 1998 Japanese Parent and Child Mega Battle Event Trophy </strong>card listed on Yahoo!

To  get rare Japan exclusive cards such as limited print promotional, event, and trophy cards.It&#8217;s usually cheaper to buy Japanese Pokemon cards from Japan than from your local retailers. Some listings of individual cards on Japanese auctions (Yahoo! JAPAN Auction) and online flea market services have considerable resale values.\n\n\n\nFor example, here&#8217;s a price comparison of the Kangaskhan 1998 Japanese Parent and Child Mega Battle Event Trophy card between listings on Yahoo! JAPAN Auction and eBay. \n\n\n\nOn Yahoo Auction: The Kangaskhan card was won at 900,000 yen (approx. $8.532) with a buyout price of 1.25M yen. This card was described as being in mint condition. Since most Japanese sellers are not familiar with the PSA card grading system, they usually describe their card as mint, near mint, good condition, bad condition, etc. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn eBay: There are listings from 5,493,297 yen (approx. 50,000 USD) for a PSA 3 Very Good graded card to 54,383,652 yen (approx. 500,000 USD) for a PSA 10 Gem Mint graded card, with an market average of 28,586,407 yen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe non-graded mint Kangaskhan 1998 Japanese Parent and Child Mega Battle Event Trophy card listed on Yahoo! JAPAN Auction was 6 times cheaper than the PSA 3 graded card and 60 times cheaper than the PSA 10 gem mint card on eBay.  \n\n\n\nBuy Japanese Pokemon cards on Buyee! \n\n\n\nBuyee is a Japanese proxy service. It allows people living outside of Japan to purchase goods and merchandise from Japanese online stores and auctions, including Yahoo! JAPAN Auction.

Some of these board games date back centuries, but they are still enjoyed to this day due to their creativity and challenge. This article will cover 5 of these traditional games, along with 5 more modern ones that may feel more familiar to you!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"danraku2\">5 Top Traditional Japanese Board Games</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Shogi: Chess with a Japanese Spin</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://buyee.jp/rakuten/detail/igolabo%3A10003212\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/imgrc0083110551.jpg\" alt=\"A portable folding Shogi board with pieces\" class=\"wp-image-7989\" srcset=\"https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/imgrc0083110551.jpg 512w, https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/imgrc0083110551-300x300.jpg 300w, https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/imgrc0083110551-150x150.jpg 150w, https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/imgrc0083110551-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /></a><figcaption>A portable folding Shogi board with pieces</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>Similar to chess, this two-player board game involves strategy, patience and cunning. There are 20 pieces per side with different abilities and rules for each piece. Unlike chess, units can be promoted once they reach the back row of the board, giving them extra movement abilities. Shogi allows players to take captured enemy units as their own, which keeps the game dynamic until the last move.

        "content_text": "When you first think about Japanese games, the first thing that comes to mind may be Mario or Sonic, but Japan has enjoyed dozens of unique tabletop games since long before anyone ever picked up a game controller! Some of these board games date back centuries, but they are still enjoyed to this day due to their creativity and challenge. This article will cover 5 of these traditional games, along with 5 more modern ones that may feel more familiar to you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 Top Traditional Japanese Board Games\n\n\n\nShogi: Chess with a Japanese Spin\n\n\n\n\n\nA portable folding Shogi board with pieces\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to chess, this two-player board game involves strategy, patience and cunning. There are 20 pieces per side with different abilities and rules for each piece. Unlike chess, units can be promoted once they reach the back row of the board, giving them extra movement abilities. Shogi allows players to take captured enemy units as their own, which keeps the game dynamic until the last move. Though complex, beginners can also have fun, which is why it is the most popular board game in Japan!\n\n\n\nSee More on Rakuten\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo: The Ancient Asian Game of Strategy\n\n\n\n\n\nA beginner&#8217;s Go set with introductory books\n\n\n\n\n\nGo is generally considered to be the world&#8217;s oldest board game. Players take turns placing black and white stones on the board&#8217;s intersecting gridlines with the goal of forming territories by surrounding and capturing their opponent&#8217;s pieces. The game rewards patience and balance over aggression and greed. Go&#8217;s simple rules can be learned quickly, but it takes a lifetime to master. The staggering number of possibilities in any given game has made it quite popular worldwide. \n\n\n\nSee More on Rakuten\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGomoku: Simple at First, But Built to Last!\n\n\n\n\n\nA traditional Gomoku set (the same materials as a Go set)\n\n\n\n\n\nGomoku, or &#8216;five in a row&#8217;, is a very different type of game from Go, but is played with the same stones and board. Players alternate placing their pieces on the board, trying to create a line of five in a row. The challenge comes not only from blocking the other player, but also making sure you don&#8217;t exceed five stones per line. Unlike Go, the pieces can not move once they&#8217;re played. Think of it as the ultimate version of tic tac toe!\n\n\n\nSee More on Rakuten\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJapanese Mahjong: New Twists on an Old Favorite\n\n\n\n\n\nA portable Mahjong set\n\n\n\n\n\nMahjong is a traditional tile-based game where you play with three other players to try and form winning hands. In the West it is often compared to poker or rummy. Japanese Mahjong has it own unique and specific rules that make for a different experience! Worldwide, Mahjong&#8217;s popularity has only risen in recent years, and maybe with an easy-to-use portable set you could join the fad as well!\n\n\n\nSee More on Yahoo! JAPAN Shopping\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSugoroku: Slap First and Win in This Classic Japanese Card Game!\n\n\n\n\n\nA kids-focused Sugoroku set designed after a map of Japan\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you talk about the classic board game sugoroku in Japanese, there is the ban-sugoroku (board sugoroku) variety and the e-sugoroku (picture sugoroku) variety, which have different playstyles. A game with centuries of history in Japan, where its use in gambling caused it to be banned multiple times, sugoroku has stayed popular as a game anyone can enjoy in many ways. For example, the left image shows a sugoroku set meant for young kids to learn about the locations of Japan as they play!\n\n\n\nSee More on Rakuten\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 Trending Modern Japanese Board Games\n\n\n\nDonjara: An Easier Mahjong For Kids!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba themed Donjara set \n\n\n\n\n\nDonjara, also known as Ponjan, is a simplified version of Japanese Mahjong aimed at children. It can be played with 2 to 4 players, and produces tie-in sets with franchises enjoyed by younger audiences to maintain its popularity, such as Youkai Watch, Doraemon, or as the left image shows, the recent hit anime series Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba!\n\n\n\nSee More on Rakuten\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Jinsei Game: Playing Japan&#8217;s Game of Life\n\n\n\n\n\nA full play set of the Jinsei Game\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially released by Takara Tomy in 1967, the Jinsei Game is the Japanese version of The Game of Life, a board game which many Western audiences are familiar with. The rules of the Jinsei Game differ slightly from The Game of Life, having players first go through the initial life stages of childhood development. While some game details have changed over the years, its core rules still remain the same, continuing to entertain generations of Japanese families.\n\n\n\nSee More on Yahoo! JAPAN Shopping\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hatteiu Game: A Recent Trending Hit Game!\n\n\n\n\n\nA copy of the Hatteiu Game\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hatteiu Game is a Japanese game that just began gaining popularity recently, with its first edition only having been released in 2018! As it is so recent, a standard translation of the title has not been set, but based on the rules, a name like &#8216;The Say Something Game&#8217; would fit! You get a theme for each round that has a list of ways to say a single words. Players get a card telling them what style they play. By viewing each act and betting chips on what style it was, the players accumulate points for right answers and correct votes on their act! Japanese knowledge might be required, but you can watch the video below to see how a typical game goes!\n\n\n\nSee More on Yahoo!

Players play as shop clerks ordering fruit from a gorilla. However, players are unable to see the full inventory list, so other players can use the small bell game piece to tell the gorilla if the other player is ordering too much. The winner is the player who manages to make the gorilla angry the least!\n\n\n\nSee More on Yahoo!

Work with other players to construct criss-crossing highways and columns from the set pieces. Each time your road crosses over or under another player&#8217;s road, you get to place one car on the highway. But beware &#8211; if you accidentally knock over someone else&#8217;s car or highway piece, you must give them an equivalent number of column pieces as a penalty! The first player to reach 10 cars on the road wins!\n\n\n\nSee More on Rakuten\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchasing Japanese Board Games Online\n\n\n\nIf you are curious about giving some of these different styles of Japanese board games a try, proxy shipping services like Buyee are the simplest way to get Japan-only games from the seller to you!

In Japan, you are able to enter this lottery by making purchases at a variety of convenience stores, bookstores and anime merchandise shops. Since a Pokemon Ichiban Kuji event was held in 2003 at participating 7-Eleven stores, this lottery has featured an ever-growing selection of franchises such as the Gundam or One Piece series. The limited availability period and exclusive, high quality goods offered in Ichiban Kuji lotteries are just some of the reasons for their enduring popularity. As an example, just last month there was a new Kimetsu no Yaiba: Demon Slayer Ichiban Kuji event. In the early morning hours of the day that this event started, there were long lines already waiting to make their lottery purchases, and the lottery was sold out by the end of that same day!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://buyee.jp/item/yahoo/auction/h498801133?conversionType=search_suggest\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/i-img1200x900-15984015191hphmz2566543-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Ichibankuji Kimetsu no Yaiba\" class=\"wp-image-7556\" srcset=\"https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/i-img1200x900-15984015191hphmz2566543-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/i-img1200x900-15984015191hphmz2566543-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/i-img1200x900-15984015191hphmz2566543-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.buyee.jp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/i-img1200x900-15984015191hphmz2566543.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><figcaption>Kimetsu no Yaiba: Demon Slayer series Ichiban Kuji prizes</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>While there are a lot of anime and game series featured in Ichiban Kuji lotteries, it has branched out into other categories as well. These include Disney characters such as Mickey Mouse, popular franchises like Rilakkuma and Sumikko Gurashi, and idol merchandise from bands like AAA and JO1. The Ichiban Kuji lottery system also includes offshoots such as Ichiban Kuji Premium and Ichiban Kuji V.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"danraku2\">How to Participate in an Ichiban Kuji Contest</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is how you join an Ichiban Kuji lottery at participating Japanese convenience stores. When you first enter the store, you should see Ichiban Kuji vouchers displayed on the counter in front of the cash register along with other goods. Take this and go to the register. At the register, tell the staff the number of entries you would like, and then pay at the counter. The lottery tickets are inside a raffle box, so once you pay for your entries, insert your hand into the box and pull out as many tickets as you paid for. The convenience store staff can open the tickets you pulled for you. If any say that you have won a certain rank of prize, then you can trade these directly with the staff member for the corresponding prize!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"danraku2\">The Recommended Way to Get Prizes from Overseas</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you do not live in Japan, don&#8217;t worry! If you can&#8217;t buy tickets directly at a convenience store in Japan, there are still ways to get your favorite prizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Purchase Merch Listed on Yahoo! Auction JAPAN and Mercari via Proxy Purchase Sites</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With this method, you can be sure that you get what you want. The only issue is that prices can be high.

        "content_text": "Ichiban Kuji is Great for Game and Anime Merch Fans!\n\n\n\nDo you know about the Japanese &#8216;Ichiban Kuji&#8217; lottery contests? In Japan, you are able to enter this lottery by making purchases at a variety of convenience stores, bookstores and anime merchandise shops. Since a Pokemon Ichiban Kuji event was held in 2003 at participating 7-Eleven stores, this lottery has featured an ever-growing selection of franchises such as the Gundam or One Piece series. The limited availability period and exclusive, high quality goods offered in Ichiban Kuji lotteries are just some of the reasons for their enduring popularity. As an example, just last month there was a new Kimetsu no Yaiba: Demon Slayer Ichiban Kuji event. In the early morning hours of the day that this event started, there were long lines already waiting to make their lottery purchases, and the lottery was sold out by the end of that same day!\n\n\n\n\n\nKimetsu no Yaiba: Demon Slayer series Ichiban Kuji prizes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there are a lot of anime and game series featured in Ichiban Kuji lotteries, it has branched out into other categories as well. These include Disney characters such as Mickey Mouse, popular franchises like Rilakkuma and Sumikko Gurashi, and idol merchandise from bands like AAA and JO1. The Ichiban Kuji lottery system also includes offshoots such as Ichiban Kuji Premium and Ichiban Kuji V.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Participate in an Ichiban Kuji Contest\n\n\n\nHere is how you join an Ichiban Kuji lottery at participating Japanese convenience stores. When you first enter the store, you should see Ichiban Kuji vouchers displayed on the counter in front of the cash register along with other goods. Take this and go to the register. At the register, tell the staff the number of entries you would like, and then pay at the counter. The lottery tickets are inside a raffle box, so once you pay for your entries, insert your hand into the box and pull out as many tickets as you paid for. The convenience store staff can open the tickets you pulled for you. If any say that you have won a certain rank of prize, then you can trade these directly with the staff member for the corresponding prize!\n\n\n\nThe Recommended Way to Get Prizes from Overseas\n\n\n\nEven if you do not live in Japan, don&#8217;t worry! If you can&#8217;t buy tickets directly at a convenience store in Japan, there are still ways to get your favorite prizes.\n\n\n\nPurchase Merch Listed on Yahoo! Auction JAPAN and Mercari via Proxy Purchase Sites\n\n\n\nWith this method, you can be sure that you get what you want. The only issue is that prices can be high.
